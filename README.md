# Classroom - A Django-based Discussion Forum Application

## Project Overview
Classroom is a Django-based web application that provides a discussion forum-like experience for users. The application allows users to login, create chat rooms, post questions or comments, and engage in discussions around various topics. Key features of the Classroom application include:

1. **User Authentication**: Users can register, login, and manage their profiles, including viewing their created rooms and recent activity.

2. **Room Creation and Browsing**: Authenticated users can create new discussion rooms on various topics. Users can also browse and join existing rooms to participate in ongoing conversations.

3. **Messaging and Discussions**: Within each room, users can post messages, ask questions, and respond to others' comments, facilitating an interactive discussion forum.

4. **User Profiles**: Users can view each other's profiles, which include their created rooms and recent comment activity. Profile pages also provide links to the user's GitHub and LinkedIn profiles (if provided).

5. **Topic Browsing**: Users can browse and filter discussions by topic to quickly find relevant conversations.
